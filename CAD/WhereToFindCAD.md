# Where can I find the CAD files for the PinkPanther Robot?
You will find everything you need to download in GrabCAD at the following link: https://grabcad.com/library/pinkpanther-quadruped-robot-1

Included is the assembly of the entire robot with which one can generate the URDF (already included in this repo, but useful for reference).

For convenience to those building the robot, the parts to be 3D printed or laser cut can be found in their own folders.

The SolidWorks drawings (and PDFs of them) are also included for a BOM of all other components (PDFs already in this repo as well).
